**OpsLoop** helps small teams turn repeatable tasks into collaborative checklists. Build a template once, run it anytime, track progress as work happens, and collect feedback so your processes improve over time.
**OpsLoop** thinks in steps and works in loops to make your team more efficient, aligned, and ready for _whatever comes next_.
